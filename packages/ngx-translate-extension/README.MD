### A extensible library of ngx-translate for Angular Internationalization with spectacular features.

> Ngx-translate is superb library, but less activly managed and this library adds the features of those which are not available in the ngx-translate or enhance the current features as well as fix the bugs.

#### For Existing ngx-translate developer community
##### How much code change is required to avail the ngx-translate-extension features.
1. You have to replace the package name <b>@ngx-translate/core</b> to <b>@rxweb/ngx-translate-extesion</b>.
2. ```TranslateModule.forChild``` will not work anymore, you have to use ```@componentTranslate``` or ```@translate``` decorator on component level with translation name(folder name). Don't worry nothing will break even you will get more ðŸ˜Ž.
3. Add ```RxTranslateModule``` on Root level.
That's it.
##### How can be sure that after replacing the package name, everything will work as expected?
We have copied the spec from [@ngx-translate/core](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core/tree/master/projects/ngx-translate/core/tests) project and follows the above mentioned steps, [it's working as expected](https://github.com/rxweb/rxweb/tree/master/test/ngx-translate-extension). Please refer the [Spec Code Comparision Page](https://docs.rxweb.io/ngx-translate-extension/comparison/translate-store).
